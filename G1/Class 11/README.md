# Exercise 

# Part 3
Create an end to end implementation about Users. A User has:

* Username
* Password ( Hashed )
* First Name
* Last Name
* Favorite Genre
* MoviesList  

The user's endpoints from the first workshop class that you have probably implemented are:

* Create/Register new user
* Get all users
* Get user by id
* Get all user's movies rented

Plus add the following endpoints for handling of users

* Authenticate existing user
* Delete existing user
* Update user's subscription
 

# Bonus 
Please consider that for the Authenticate endpoint you need to implement authenticatioin/authorization with
JWT token.
