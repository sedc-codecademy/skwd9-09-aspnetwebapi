## Part 2

## Requirements 

This time, it is required from you to make a refactor of your already existing implementation or you can either create a new app and start it from scratch. The main requirements are that you need to:

* Finish the previous workshop things that you left (if any)
* Create an N-tier architecture implementation
* Configure and connect database using EntityFramework code first approach (Or you can use ADO.NET/Dapper)
* Seed data in order to test the DB
* Test a few endpoints by using Postman and make them work correctly
